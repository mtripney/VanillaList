# VanillaList 🛍 🗒️
_A shopping list/todo list app written in vanilla JavaScript, using custom events and local storage. Styled with Tailwind._

Yes, there's always a Todo app. This one was built with the intention of being a useful little shopping list tool, but it's happy to be turned to any list-oriented purpose.
